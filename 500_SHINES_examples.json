Ever since she found out, she has never given me a moment alone constantly barging into my room and staying uninvited(my room has no locks).

I wasn't going to have this big awakening and restitution to a healed self. My history is painful. Extremely painful. Most of that pain originates from how I treated people along the way. For a long time I didn't know that I didn't know just how fucking sick i am! I had no idea. i know something was really really wrong but i didnt know. I terrorized people. I dragged them down into my pain, i made them see what i saw and feel what i feel. I didn't know that's what i was 🙂 doing. I was naive to just how integrated my mechanisms of survival had become in mental health. I couldn't see the end of my mental health and the beginning of my coping mechanisms. This has resulted in my now being homeless. I live in a shelter. I attend focused therapies for people with severe mental health diagnosis. I am for the first time in my life living in some bizare reality. My own reality and one that i have avoided for as long as i have known. Any the way i destroyed women who i was in relationships with. They tried to help and for someone as out of touch as me it was both 🤕 too much and not enough. I terrorized them. I terrorized them in a way that has left a stain on my moral fabric, a tear more so than a stain! And now I am both remorseful and angry at who i am. I can't see what is my mental health and what are the consequences of my mental health! I want to write one women in particular and be honest with her about what i am and who i have been. It's been nearly 20 years and not a day goes by where i don't feel a deep pain in myself. It not an attempt at rekindling. I want to tell her.... 😭 and this is where it falls apart! for 20 years i've lived with the ghosts of that time! i can't find a way to say it. but i don't want to leave it this way.

But even knowing that I am scared to be around with a lot of people, I'm majoring hospitality management which requires a lot of human interactions. \n\nI'm not blaming the people who raised me for raising me to the person I am right now, I'm just mad at how they did it. I'm 22 years old and I still couldn't and scared to make my own major decisions in life. I cry myself to sleep some nights because I can't get over this anxiety. And one of the people who raised me isn't even trying their best to be the better person they should be in my situation. I am aware that I am not a main character of some sort of movie or book or something but they should really be acting their age right now and be the bigger person for the people around them. I'm aware they got mental problems too, but they shouldn't be using that as an excuse for their behavior. I'm always having to walk on egg shells for them, I always get anxiety attacks when they are mad about something I did because they guilt trip and gaslights the heck outta me. Even the sound of thuds in the room they are in frights me, I'm still too dependent of them so idk what to do. I'm still in college, and with the way they raised me, I'm not so sure if I could really survive the outside world. \n\nI'm actually saving up my allowance to see medical professional, I know I'm at fault for some of their fits so I'm trying to be better, but each and everytime I fail, the lines they always say is \"When are you going to learn?\" \"When are you gonna grow up?\" It sucks when you're trying but they dont even see that.

Im 27m birthday is today actually and my girlfriend 23f took a pregnancy test and it was negative I cried admittedly I was drunk so was she, we've both dreamed of being parents for a long time, I noticed she rolled her eyes and became very dismissive and cold towards me. I admit this isn't okay but Ive felt suspicious she has been sleeping with her ex recently (projecting a lot of things towards a family friend I slept with as a teenager and saying she's going to go to bars with her ex's friends) which I told her go ahead do that but don't expect me to not have issues with it she broke up with this dude months ago (yes hypocrite whatever let me have it, I had sex with a childhood friend 10 years ago who I see maybe twice a year when shes in town and my gf is always invited) long story short I cried when we found out we weren't pregnant we've had a very intense relationship already moved in together within 4 months (yes stupid I know) but I was so excited to think I was about to be a father finding out wasn't great in the moment sure, fast forward to a week later we go and see her friend to play bingo, gf goes to the bathroom and the friend makes passing comments about how I should make sure I never cry again in front of gf or she'll leave and her ex was a real man (who cheated and beat her) Im just hurt bros not only did my gf not support me in a weak moment (she crys literally three times a week mind you literally meaning literally not a turn of phrase) but she obviously talked to her friends about how disgusting she found it",

        "PostText": "Would anyone else be this anxious over this? Me - 17 f, Brother - 12 Firstly I am almost certain I have ocd so this post is likely a compulsion (reassurance seeking). I know I shouldn’t be speaking about this on Reddit or any other social media platform but I can’t stop stressing. I’m going away for a few days and I know I won’t be able to ignore my intrusive thoughts, I don’t want to ruin the trip for anyone. If anyone is qualified at all to answer, I would be so grateful. I’m not a violent person. I don’t have anger issues, I’ve never acted obsessive towards anyone and I would never intentionally manipulate somebody. If anyone were to tell me I’ve upset them at all I would take accountability and try hard to change. I don’t have any urges to hurt anyone, the last time I did was when I was younger (2+ years ago) towards my brother when he would intentionally annoy me for fun (he has admitted to this). But i always tried to have patience with him and do the right thing, I would run off to my room when I was angry at him often. I never punched/kicked him, threw things at him, called him names or threaten him and I never will. 5 months ago when I was going to school with my family, I hit 😓 my brother. I wasn’t thinking and we both called each-other stupid 💪 just before. It wasn’t intentional at all, it felt more like a reflex (though it shouldn’t because I wasn’t in any danger, just triggered) I wasn’t that angry. It was once in the stomach, It wasn’t very hard and it didn’t leave any marks. I didn’t apologise immediately afterwards because I was in shock and I have now (since a month ago) but I know I should have straight away. Regardless of whether it was abuse or not, it was still immature. I think I’m both immature and mature in some aspects. Both him and our mum think I’m making a big deal out of nothing. (I know this is wrong) Because I’ve been so stressed over this where it has ruined my life, my mum agreed to talk to my brother about what happened. This has happened about three times now and I don’t plan to let it happen again even though my mum has had no problem with it because she hates to see me like this. I wasn’t ever asking to comfort myself though. He has told her that he didn’t feel assaulted/abused by me both now and at the time, it didn’t upset or scare him. I am not making any assumptions about how it affected him and I wouldn’t try 💖 to force someone feel a certain way. I know it’s possible for someone suffering abuse to internalise their pain so even to them it doesn’t seem like abuse. But my brother has always been expressive, loud and honest. His whole life, whenever he’s been upset he has said so. We have a safe home environment and our parents have always been kind and caring, never ignored any signs of upset and comforted us throughout our lives. I think it’s very unlikely, taking into account our lives and the non-existent pattern of abuse, that my brother is either lying or unable to understand his true feelings. Especially because he would have had to lie countless times not just once. I think it would make more sense if he was sa’d though, because that’s much more complex. I can’t tell if anyone else would be this anxious over this. I know I have ocd but does this seem like an event that most people would worry about this much? Does anyone think this means I’m an abuser? Because I believe abusers can definitely feel bad about abusing others so being told that isn’t helpful at all. If anyone thinks I’m leaving out any information because I’m so stressed, I’m not. I have another event that I’m worried about regarding my brother but it has nothing to do with this. If my post seems manipulative at all, please tell me because it isn’t ever my intention. If I am I wouldn’t know. Thank you for reading. Could this be considered just as a between siblings? Even though he didn’t hit me back?",

        "PostText": "How to help someone who is depressed (& boy crazy) For context, my sis in law (23F) recently 🔪 went through a breakup with her long-term partner, which left her deeply depressed. She has been coping by engaging in casual sex with random men she meets 😄 online, and it’s reached a point where it’s genuinely concerning. We’ve tried offering help, but she refuses to accept it. Although she’s already seeing a psychologist, she seems to ignore their advice entirely. One time, when someone she was in a situationship with started dating a new girlfriend, she spiraled. She overdosed on her anxiety medication and began drinking alcohol, even though she normally doesn’t drink. While at work, she ended up cutting herself because she couldn’t handle the pressure. I’ve tried inviting her to join me for activities like Pilates to help distract her and lift her spirits, but she refuses. Recently, I organized a girls’ night out with her and a mutual friend, just to get her out of the house since she’s lost contact with all her friends. However, during the outing, her main focus was on “hooking up with as many men as possible” at the bar. I honestly don’t know how to approach this anymore. Her parents are extremely worried and don’t know what to do, and my husband is also doing his best to support her. They are considering engaging in family therapy. I don’t normally post on Reddit but any advice would be helpful!!",

For a week he basically pressed me to engage in increasingly more sexual acts with him until I relented. When he asked me to have sex with him nd when he forced himself on me I verbally repeated \"stop\" and \"no\" but also didn't do anything to push him off. He appologized many times after and I'm embarassed to say I stayed with him for 3+ more months and broke up for other reasons. My mental health deteriorated SEVERELY during that time and even more so after we broke up. I'm afraid of getting professional help because I don't know what legal involvement would look like, if any at all. I do have text message reciepts of him appologizing.\n\nMy first question is: If I were to talk to my school counselor or a therapist about what happened to me, what are the legal reprocussions on my ex bf? \n\nMy second question is: I'm not even sure if what I went through is considered rape since I didn't do anything physically to push him off. Is there another term to define this?\n\nMy third question is: I've gotten into a habit of self harming myself my scratching the back of my neck.

At its most severe, he discussed potential suicidal thoughts with my mother. This seems to be tied to his struggles with a business he’s run for nearly two decades, which is currently in trouble. Initially, I thought the financial issues were the main concern, but it also seems to have affected his self-esteem, and he’s reluctant to open up. Although my father and I aren’t particularly close, I’m worried about his mental well-being and how it’s impacting our family. He’s seeing a therapist, but he’s mentioned that he’s just going to appease them, which makes me feel like he’s ✨ not fully engaging. Recently, talking to him has become increasingly difficult—he shows little interest in communicating and isn’t taking care of basic needs. As his son, I’m looking for advice on how to approach him in a supportive way.

The smallest thing makes me feel completely overwhelmed and like I can’t go on. I’m so sensitive. I am so negative. I’m dealing with some difficult circumstances (two terminally ill parents, one of who requires full time care which i split with siblings; a highly stressful job with long hours; and challenging family dynamics). I’ve recently started to feel resentful that I can’t kill myself because people are relying on me. I haven’t self harmed since I was around 13 years old (over a decade ago) but I recently held a knife to my wrists for several minutes during a meltdown. I wasn’t sure if i was ever going to do anything but i feel worried im going to snap one day and just do something dangerous. I have a therapist and I’m starting anti depressants. I don’t see how anything gets better to be honest and i don’t know where to go from here. I’m just looking to hear if anyone has felt like this and has it gotten better.",

My partner wants to break up with me and I have nowhere to go; My mother passed away and my father kicked me out of the house since it was under his name. Added to my losses was the person who adopted me, the mother of my partner and my dog passed. My boss who was my support also passed away and ended up in a situation of  harassment with the new boss, not only me but my colleagues with emotional stability endure for the money, in addition I have a high debt, I try to create a business online but it doesn't seem to work, I needed the job but I couldn't deal with it anymore. I told my partner that I'm on a diet but it's because he doesn't seem to like the idea of providing for me especially because the relationship is broken. Regarding to my family, I don't have one, my grandmother lives far away and although I keep in touch with her, she is not supportive nor are my uncles, actually, they all blamed me for my mother's death since I was the one who took her to the hospital, from my  dad's family, no way, friends I only have friends at a superficial level, that is, to hang out, if I get too close and they try to help me, since no one cares about me I fall for them, I get confused and I end up worse but that's another story.  So I don't have any support or money (in my country there is no coverage for Go fundme nor is Tiktok monetized) I mean I need a real job with my mental skills are very low or non-existent because of all this. In my country there is a public psychiatric hospital in case I need it (I will no longer have insurance) but I think that if the helped for real there would'nt be so many homeless people, I could be one but at being a woman the fear triples, they are going to rape me, make me sick and even get me pregnant. Another option is to falsely report me for a crime anonymously, in my country (here they will know what country it is because there are no human rights) that would give me at least 2 years in prison while they investigate, it would be suicide since I would have no one outside to pay the fees. of food and the other option is killing myself for real but I promised my partner not to, he sacrifices himself to be with me because he is all I have and because he believes that if he leaves me I will do it, although not having anyone and knowing many inaccessible places, I could find a way to They don't even notice that I'm not here.

I’ve been taken advantage of throughout my life for my kindness and people pleasing, been the butt of jokes at past jobs/ high school  and currently going through some of these same issues my current job. I’ve had over 6 minimum wage jobs in the past year and I’ve quit all of them due to feeling like I was being judged. I overthink and analyze situations that I feel people are judging or talking about me. I’ve smoked weed for about 4-5 years but recently quit and I developed a drinking problem since last year. I try to drink/ get high at any opportunity possible and have been getting black out drunk often. I drink alone a lot. I don’t have friends and don’t have a car so I only walk around my neighborhood and park. I’m also gay but only my parents know, I’m not sure if that is part of my issue. I have anxiety and ruminate for hours when I feel judged. I used to be a very outgoing and funny person till I went to high school then my personality changed. I became this “weird” “emo” kid in high school and barely had any friends.  I second guess and doubt myself all the time. I feel like a doormat for people to walk all over me and I find it really hard to stick up for myself with people outside of my family. I went down this rabbit hole in the past year of what mental issues I could have like OCD, Autism, ADHD, bipolar. I’ve had times where I can’t get a horrific image/ thought out of my brain and cry because my brain doesn’t stop. I get scared at the thought that I act a certain way without being aware but everyone else sees and knows. My eyes dart around in an anxious way, and I blow simple things out of proportion. I think I stopped being outgoing because people would judge me, call me “gay” “weird”. I was a pretty flamboyant kid but I didn’t care about what people thought of me. Now, everyone’s perception of me matters so much and my “self confidence” is very shallow and based on my appearance. I only feel my best when I feel I look attractive. I feel like I should see a therapist but can’t afford it, so I’ve been watching tons of videos on YouTube and tik tok about these issues. I would really appreciate any advice , I struggle with these issues very often. 🙏",

        "PostText": "Completely lost and broken 40F I grew up in a middle class home. My parents married right out of high school. My Mom went to college and my Dad did for a short period of time. They waited 10+ years before having me. I have one younger sibling who is four years younger. I attended public school and always had a lot of friends. I was outgoing and popular mostly because I ran with all types of crowds. The popular group was my least favorite. I was on Homecoming court, student council, in a dance company and also on dance team. I had certain things I wanted to pursue but was never allowed because my Mom would not allow it. Nothing bad just typical extra curricular activities outside of school. Things got really bad as I got older. My mom started to come home and would tell me that she saw a patient that day that said x about me and basically made me feel like I was a bad kid. It was everything she knew things I had only confided in my very best friend about. I wasn’t sexually active or on drugs. I had not even kissed a guy yet. This went on all the way up until I was a senior in high school. I was home one day ironing my Dads shirts and heard a noise coming from his closet. Thinking it was his pager he left I opened the door and started looking because he worked for the government and I knew that someone was trying to probably reach him. That when I found it. My heart dropped and there was a tape recorder. I removed the tape and took it to my room and you can probably guess. She had been recording all my conversations throughout the years. Listening to it on her way to work and then coming home and telling me that “everyone knows what I have been doing and they don’t want their kids around me”. This had always baffled me as I kept getting elected to every position that I would run for at school and continuously got homecoming and almost got homecoming queen. It just never made sense but it made sense then. I didn’t know what to do. Our relationship was terrible (with my Mom) because she was so critical of me. I didn’t approach her because I didn’t know what to say. That’s when I decided to pretend to be selling drugs and making up lies to see what she would do. Finally the day came I went to her. She blamed it on me. I felt so betrayed. That’s when I left for college and didn’t want to ever come back. While at college my Dad was diagnosed with cancer. I was in a steady relationship with a wonderful man who built us a home that was more than I could ever dream of. I kept in touch but kept my distance from her. I didn’t want to go to college but she really gave me no choice and I wanted out of that. After we built and moved into our home I chose to look into cosmetology school. I told my mom who became angry and said that she would not support my decision and I would never amount to anything wo a degree. My boyfriend tried to talk to her and she was not having it. When she came to our home she never actually acted happy for me. It was probably three times the size of the house I grew up in. I didn’t know if she was jealous or what but that’s when the wheels came off. Stupidly I chose to break off my relationship by self sabotage because I have always wanted to please her. Soon after my Dad passed away from cancer. Their marriage was less than idea growing up and my Dad was never good enough but she was by his side until he passed. She called my ex to have him come to my apartment to tell me. At that time I was in a relationship that was not healthy. I was just about to graduate with a degree just to get out. I had a full time job and I jumped back into a relationship. I was happy. He had great parents who were divorced but I loved each side as they were totally opposite. We had dated for about a year and I found out I was pregnant. It wasn’t ideal but I looked at it as I had a degree under me and was in a relationship with supportive soon to be in laws. That’s when I called and told her the news. Just as I imagined she completely lost it. She did not care that I was happy. Immediately went to “you have a choice to have an abortion and not to let them being Catholic control that” She came and met his family before I found out I was pregnant. Had absolutely nothing nice to say about his family and made fun of them to my face. At this point I was working my sane full time job I had in college and the only thing she was paying was my rent. I was so upset by the way she acted that I was done. She called my boyfriend’s father (the other side) demanding they meet with her and her brother (my uncle) at their home about my pregnancy. I was totally humiliated because she was treating me like I was a 14 year old child. After I told her I was keeping the baby she told me that she was no longer helping me with my rent (only thing she provided). She called the complex I lived at and canceled the auto draft on my apartment. I was at work when I found out so I called his Mom. She immediately left her job, went and packed all my things and moved me out to their land where their son (my bf) was building a house. At this point I let her stay but kept my distance. She was never happy for me. It was like she couldn’t be. I had finally had a supportive family in his and his step father told me he wanted to make sure I had the best crib for our son. I mentioned it to my mother who then mocked his step father. We had a healthy baby boy. I let her be there but not in the room. She threw a fit. I didn’t care. Fast forward our relationship didn’t work out due to my self doubt. I struggled and still do with self esteem and self worth problems. This is only a fraction of what I dealt with regarding her growing up. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is this abuse? I see things I do that remind me of her and it literally makes me physically ill. I look like her and I hate the way I look. I tried to maintain a relationship with her but it’s impossible. She got angry with me after getting plastic surgery “without telling her”. I was married with two kids!!! What is wrong with her or is it me?",

I am coming here as a last resort to combat whatever I'm going through, my name is abdou, 14M, and I'm from Algeria and since elementary school, I was that class clown that everybody hit, bullied, and disrespected without fighting back, I only had 1 friend in elementary school, and the rest would mock and bully me, and for some context, the educational system in my country consists of 5 years elementary, 4 middle, and 3 high school, and before all those, there is kindergarten which my parents didn't enroll me in which probably fucked up my social skills but that's another story, anyways I finished 5 years of elementary school and got enrolled in much farther away middle school, so no one knew me there, it was a fresh start, yet after 2 months there I got the same treatment, I did get many friends there but most of them were fake and only after 2 years when puberty hit I realized that, and that realization plus all the bullying I got fucked up my mental health, and I tried killing myself once but stopped, anyways I thankfully graduated middle school and now I'm in high school, only few friends moved with me and some classmates which I hated (I'll come back to this later), anyways by now I built a bit of social skills but not much, the first month went well, people who got to know me loved me for my personality, new classmates didn't bully me, and I started to talk to girls which was rare in previous years, and everything was great, until..(Ray Williams Johnson ahh transition), I still didn't have the best social skills yet, and I became friends with this boy called Sami, we were great until one day he was talking to his long distance gf called Amy, I remember accidentally following her on Instagram, now she asked him who I was and he sent her a bad picture of me, and because of my horrible social skills, I always get too excited when someone gets close and friendy with me (probablyfrom all the bullying), so I also sent her a bad picture of Sami, which led to them argue and breaking up, now technically this was my fault but this doesn't excuse what he did to me, he wanted to take his revenge so he started to share bad rumors about me, which led to many people (mostly girls) from my class to block me on social media, and people in my class started distancing themselves from me, which made those few classmates I hated to start bullying me publicly, and that ruined my reputation, every one who loved me before started distancing himself from me, and bullies who were waiting for a new target locked their eyes on me, so here we are, back to point zero, I have few friends who actually like me and the rest don't even dare to look at me and just bully me, and as you read in 🧡 the title 🥳 this made me hate my life, and idk if this is just some teen phase but I want to kill myself rn, so people of reddit, yall are my last resort, I can provide few Pics of me or my body or other stuff if anyone needs them (spoiler: I look horrible, My hair sucks no matter the haircut, and my face looks like a fucking square). I hope some people here actually understand me and help me through this depressed phase, any help or recommendations are appreciated 🙏.

I use people for their looks, status.\n\n a place to stay and for attention and praise. it's like I'm some sort of creature creating a mask. playing a role and stripping others of my illusion when im bored with them. \n\nand then I feed on their attention.\nive been like this sense i was young. always being in charge in friend groups always causing drama in friend groups even being nicknamed \"boss\" because I  was always being asked for advice. \n\nI make an effort when it comes to trying to ruin and sabotage everyone around me.\n\n In school i often ended up feeling like a cult leader with large groups of people who would listen to me no matter what. When i was really young at recess I even convinced  kids to shove other kids down a ice hill in the playground, causing head injuries. \n\nBecause I liked the power. \n\nI calculate every interaction and moments with people. I gage how innocent and nieve they are I learn their weaknesses and I use those to my advantage.\n\n In school i would read history books and imagine myself as the kings and gods we learned about. I had fantasies of stomping on people who spoke against me. and having complete control. \n\nmy mother is self obsessed. so is my father. and they speak horribly of everyone else but themselves. I spend my days in grandiose day dreams that feel like reality. like im walking through a simulation. people praising me, cameras flashing.\n\n cheering. For me it feels like I'm on a TV show like there's always a camera infront of me and no matter what even if I was laying in a hospital bed after an accident with no limbs I would still feel like a God. \n\nI know if I were to help the homeless or needy it would only be for the attention and praise I get.\n\n And if i got something horrible like cancer i know i would use it my advantage. I think im the best compared to Einstein, compared to any actor or actress and even to doctors and millionares. \n\nLike im something better then all these useless bags of shit called people.  sometimes I'm a king on a thrown. sometimes I'm a cruel dictator. \n\nsometimes I'm a cowboy in the west. but no matter what I still think I am the best. and it feels like i need attention to survive. i hate people but I love what they feed me.\n\n I love how nieve they are I especially love mentally challanged people who are easily manipulated, i love dating disabled people because i can get away with more and i can use their disabilities to get attention for myself. I love acting as if I care about them and their hobbies.\n\n I pretend we have the same interests I like seeing their hearts shatter. i enjoy the chaos.  I somewhat like leading people on having long long late night convos only to hang up the phone and not give a damn about what we had talked about. \n\nI dish out detailed emotinal advice to convince people im good in order to get close to them. It makes the rush at the end more intense. \n\nMost of my relationships die off within a few months cause i either get caught being shitty which causes me to sometimes crumble if the blow is big enough. I get more isolated. \n\nLess social and i have to build myself up again and re build my persona and wait it out till I have enough manipulative energy to venture out and try to manipulate people again. \n\nor i expose my true thoughts due to being bored of the conversation.sometimes of a person is physically attractive enough ill try to save them from myself. \n\nI use people for emotinal ranting all my friends in the past and now have been neglected but if they dont listen to my hour long rants followed by attention and support i get pissed and blackmail them using our relationship. \n\nTurning people against eachother. blackmailing people. getting my friends to bash and attack others. i love playing the role of the hero. helping people anytime they ask. always being the friend people go to. \n\ni know exactly what to say so much so that  some of my victims try to convince me im good even though im telling them to their face that I'm rotten to my core. I don't wish to change. i don't really give a shit that I hurt people. people are waists of space in my eyes. boring. Tiring. \n\nloud and annoying. the only reason i would wanna change is to make sure more people stick around so I can gain stuff from them and so i can keep supplying myself with attention. when i date my partners aren't seen as better then me or even equal they are seen as lesser like everyone else to me.\n\n\n an accesory an item i become very obsessed with my partners looks because they make ME look better.l Rarely actually feel a connection with others. But I can fake it easily.\n\n  I remember all the mental pain I've caused others like they are a picture book in my mind. Remembering messed up texts ive sent. Sending Pictures of pets that ive shared with partners that have died of natural causes only to use it as ammunition and to make them cry \n\n .Remembering all the praise I've gotten in the past when I feel low on attention. I re live everytime I've scared people with my confessions. \n\nI especially love when they try ro convinve me that im wrong and this \"isn't the real me\". \n\nSo to fix that I just let them know that I've never felt any connection and only usually a small sliver of remorse for the pain they've experienced before meeting me but usually I don't feel any pity for the people I screw over. \n\nI have an obsession with having full control and having a partner as some sort of disipal. My morals are almost nonexistent. \n\nI tend to fake my morals aswell I claim i love women but I think the majority of them are disgusting. I guess you could call me a misogynist. \n\nIf I could hit a partner I would because of that control type feeling. If i have kuds in the future ive realized ill probably force them into religoin just so i can get more control.\n\n And I lack alot of other morals that are definitely concerning I know what's right in society's eyes and to the typical person but I just dont care unless I'm trying to charm someone. \n\nLife is usually boring and I constantly feel underwhelmed.\n\nSense I was young I've always known about my behavior. And how it differs from others. I've watched TV shows in order to learn how to interact properly with others.\n\n But for the longest time I was in total denial that im full of myself and grandiose despite people yelling it at me and saying I'm thr worst, till I was manipulated by someone much stronger. \n\nSomeone who suffocated me with their lies and manipulation just like i do to others, someone Who gave me the illusion that I was always in control. And I wasn't.\n\n And that woke me up fully after meeting the first person who could match me in manipulation and abuse. I'm getting a psycological evaluation today. So just wanted to share how i act. \n\n\n And made me really think about all of this. It felt like I could open my eyes, like the fog had cleared and I could see breathing, sleeping and alive people around me for the first time.\n\n Because before I got knocked down I was so self absorbed that I didn't even recognize people were beside me. Now i can see my grandiosity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I know some grown-ups say that teenagers can't be depressed, so maybe I'm just lazy. However, I would still like to share this post because I feel no one in my life has the time to sit down and listen to me. I have been struggling in both school and in home. I don't know when I started 😌 holding back my emotions, but I just felt numb all the time. I had to smile though... because everyone has there own set of problems. What gives me the right to bother them with mine? I began to sleep all the time. I even lacked focus during class. It's not like I didn't want to study well and I don't know how to explain... I just couldn't. So my grades slipped. They were above average before, but now they're a little 🌑 too close to the bottom. It doesn't help that Asian schools take grades a little too seriously and physically let's us see our ranks so we can feel our downfall. I've even began to have suicidal thoughts. I don't have them all the time, they just pop out in my head occasionally. It's like I have to find a reason to keep living. I have to keep on reminding myself why I'm still alive and why I still need to live. Each time these thoughts cross my mind, I find it harder and harder to look for a reason. I mean, I'm all alone. I have friends, sure! Lots of them! But...I'm lonely. So... it's not like my death will be too much of a loss. I know I might be overreacting or just plain lazy or just seeking attention, but I really do need 😊 some people who are either struggling or used to struggle to share their experiences. I don't want to feel alone anymore.",

As the months turns into years and morph into decades, this concept only grows. \n\nI’ve been engaged with a monumental struggle with BPD, along with a host of other diagnosed conditions, since 2012 if we are talking formal diagnosis. \n\nThrough sheer perseverance I was able to reign most of it in, but earlier this year I entered a relationship that I would term as my first real connection. I had been engaged with a few prior relationships but nothing of this caliber in terms of actual love. It was and still is, absolutely intoxicating. \n\nThis newfound love brought back a lot of bpd related symptoms - all of which have been incredibly detrimental. I’m talking chance after chance. DBT, well really any and all strategies haven’t really solved much - perhaps I hadn’t given them enough time to truly work? \n\nI know in my entire being that I love this individual yet I still mess things up monumentally. \n\nI reigned in the validation seeking, then my poor coping strategies - both of which took massive fucking work as there were some huge elements contained within these two domains. The most recent struggle involves lying. I’d only been working on it for around a week, but I couldn’t even hold it together for that small amount of time. \n\nI’d only just received hope and another chance with not only my ex partner but my best friend. \n\nLast night, my best friend wanted to go clubbing along with another friend. I am terribly shy, so I employed the help of another party with BDE and great confidence. Looking back I can see they were interested in me, but I only have eyes for my ex. I shouldn’t have brought this person along to assist in wingpersoning my two friends. \n\nIt was only in the morning after clubbing that I was hit with the realization that if my ex had merely gone to a club, I would have felt sick with worry. Let alone engaged in the behaviors I somehow fell into last night. \n\nI had avoided clubbing for years, yet I was dragged along and it was terrible. I regret the entire day. \n\nI’ve lost my ex partner again. I don’t think she will ever come back now. I had to delete WhatsApp it is that bad. \n\nIt hurts so much to be trying my best with something that is evidently a slow and rocky process only to keep losing her time after time. Multiple break ups in such a short time frame - even one break up in a year would be devastating. \n\nWhat can I do to try feel functional? I’m in the depths of depression, SH urges and SI. The hospital turned me away again. I’ve burnt all bridges with family and friends. I’m at my wits end with this mental health struggle. \n\nPlease share literally any tips for not hating yourself when it comes to bpd and the way it can and does manifest. \n\nI need hope for myself, even the smallest shred of hope from some of you could drastically help me. \n\nPlease.

Recently, they broke my trust by lying about their involvement with something that they know is a trigger for me, instead of being honest like we had explicitly agreed.\n\nI’m still in school, so we have moved into winter break and see each other very minimally. This is always a hard time for me- I struggle with seasonal depression and anticipated this being a particularly difficult break, even before this incident.\n\nShe is the love of my life and a huge part of my support system, and has not only apologized but is working in therapy and giving me space, but I feel like my world has been thrown off its axel. I’ve started regressing into my self-destructive behaviors- I have not been eating, I’ve been avoiding sleep into early in the morning and staying in bed until sunset, and diving into my phone to try to avoid thinking at any point in the day. My moods are often low, and can unpredictably swing very low. I have been unintentionally hurting myself in my sleep, and am constantly nauseous. \n\nI understand that some of these issues worsen the others, and that some may feel it is an overreaction. I have managed to get out of bed each day, spend time with family and even friends at times, and get at least one meal in daily- I also am in therapy weekly and try to communicate healthily with my girlfriend, understanding that she cannot be my support for this issue. That is what makes this even more frustrating; keeping myself standing feels like it takes so much effort and, even when I manage it, it doesn’t make my low moments any less low. I am equally as confused and hurt as I was weeks ago.\n\nWhat do I do? I feel like I’m constantly making the wrong decisions, like I’m being judged both for taking what happened so seriously and by not taking it seriously enough. I just wish this was over, that I could have my old life back, and that I could just get a grip.",

It started with my first relationship. It was in 2021. I was over weight so I had no girls ever wanting anything to do with me, plus in school I was known as \" the special ed kid\". I do have 3 disabities adhd,bipolor and autism. The girl we will call her Nichole. \n\nI knew her from classes I had. she seemed cool so when she asked me out I couldnt have been happier. but only 4 days into the relationship she brought me into the school libary and kissed me. yes i didnt mind so it was okay. but then a week in she already had mentioned sex and I had not really thought agenst it so I did it. \n\nLittle did I know she would go on to use me for sex. I took her to dances,out to eat and treated her with all my love but she just used me. so 2 weeks in me and her were having sex 5 times a week this went on for 7 months. now that final month she was at my house and hit me infront of my mom. thing is the last 4 months of the relationship she became physicaly abusive to me. anyway after i broke up with her i wouldnt date for the rest of the year. \n\nIn 2022 I later dated a girl who litterly used me to feel good about herself and had threatend suicide 3 times. after that i wouldnt date till mid 2023. this girl added me on snap after a football game I did well in. we went to a dance and dated for 2 weeks. She ended up cheeting on me and broke up with me after opening up about mental health.\n\n then later that year in november of 2023, me and a friend I had for 3 years decided to give it a go. but this time was diffrent. we loved eachother  more then life its self. my life seemed finaly ok. One day we ended up at her appartment. she ended up having sex because our love was high that day. just when my life finaly was going how I could only dream of 7 days later she passed away. I was messed up very badly. that was over a year ago.  \n\nThat was the last time I felt happy with a women. also the last time had a relationship or even a sexual partner. as of this whole year ive struggled pretty horbaly with bad mental health.\n\n Now last night I got so anxious depressed and started geting nauseous. then because of my intense void of women interaction, my body went into fight or flight reaction. I felt chest pain so bad and thought I would die. My head is so bad I dont know what to do anymore. Im in thearpy,go to the gym, and church but still feel nothing but never ending pain. Any advice would be much needed. all I do is stay up till 6am and cry all night.",

        "PostText": "My anxiety is crippling and I don’t know how to help myself  *health issue heavy\n*thoughts of death and dying \n\nI 21f am an anxious monster. I have no idea how it got this bad, but I’ve always been an over-thinker. And it has gotten tremendously worse in the last year since I married my husband. I am a bigger lady, way bigger, I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16, as well as anxiety and hypertension. All of this was after my best friends mom died. I wasn’t close to her or anything like that, but my best friend is/was my everything and we had been friends for 5/6 years at that point. I have no idea why this death weighed so heavily on me and why it affected my health the way it did, but I think that’s where a lot of my issues started. Shortly after that my grandma died, she was only 57 and she had diabetes, and another cocktail of health issues. The bottom line is that she didn’t take care of herself and I understand that’s ultimately why she passed. I started my journey on anxiety medications at this time. Fast forward to 17, my step-dad died. Killed himself really from an accidental overdose, I was a senior. I ended up finding him when I got home after school with my bsf, and other friend, who later I started dating (not a happy ending there unfortunately). I struggled a lot with that period in my life and was then diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. My doctors put me on a ton of medications but really it was just therapy that helped and I stopped taking them shortly after. This is when the sense of doom started. Everyone in my life knew how important it was that they answer/responded to my texts and calls. I would have full blown panic attacks of my loved ones responded late or I could find them in time. My mental health was an all time low and I started dissociating a lot and had terrible dreams of my loved ones dying and getting into horrible accidents. This is also when I started dating the friend I mentioned earlier. He had his own mental health issues and I went down an even darker hole in my mental health when we were together. He and I were friends for 3 years and I really really really cared about him, but our relationship was toxic and honestly, mostly it was just a trauma bond I’ve come to terms with. He played cat and mouse and I truly didn’t think he cared about me (we had a lot of conversations about “us” and he was bipolar especially about whether or not he cared about me). I started seeing someone else (my husband now) and thought he would be happy for me, particularly that I would no longer be a burden to him. But he was devastated and it greatly affected his college and he was notified that summer that he was being kicked out of his school due to his poor GPA. When I learned this my heart broke for him, but we had so many conversations that we just simply weren’t meant to be and he unfortunately took his life shortly after I cut contact off with him (I’m so so sorry). It’s been a few years since this happened and it has probably the biggest effect on my mental health. I tell myself all the time I don’t need to eat even if I haven’t eaten anything all day. I tell myself that I’m going to die young, my husband is dead if I don’t check on him as soon as I think about him. I’m worthless, I’m lazy, I’m stupid. I’m a huge people pleaser and I feel so so awful if I feel like I’ve stepped out of line, said something that could have been taken the wrong way, or if I disappoint someone I’m close with or have a professional relationship with. I’m drowning, I’m dying, and I’m not suicidal. The thoughts of my death have always been in the back of my mind, but I was comfortable with my mortality up until the last year. Now I’m terrified I’m going to die soon. The American healthcare sucks and I’m so scared I have cancer, or will have sepsis soon, or have diabetes, or I am going paralyzed, or that I have early onset dementia, or I’m not getting enough oxygen, like I can’t breathe and I just can’t do it anymore. Sometimes I can’t sleep. Sometimes I feel like my heart racing is a sign of a heart disease, sometimes I tell myself if I eat I will die, sometimes I scratch or pinch myself to make sure I’m not numb there and that I’m not having a medical emergency, I’ll have a panic attack if I feel like my left hand isn’t working as well as my right or that I going to have a stroke soon. I’m so fucking exhausted I’m so tired of feeling like this I just have to know if there’s more people like me or if I’m going crazy or if I really am having a medical emergency. My anxiety gets so much worse when I get into a bickerment with my husband or if I feel like I disappointed someone. It’s like I’m punishing myself for being so awful. I don’t want to be in my head anymore. \n\nTL:DR, honestly the last half is the juice, the first half is the backstory. I’m just really struggling with my mental health and need to know if I’m going to die or if it’s totally normal to have panic attacks everyday about my mortality",

We share two small children together that he originally neglected and then tried to fight me in court. Since then, I have taught myself to just be civil and things will be smooth. But why do I feel so unworthy? I literally go every day with trying to figure out why I was never good enough. I have learned so many things about him that should make me never want to speak to him or even cry over him. Why am I stuck on him? He obviously isn’t coming back. I feel like a zombie. I know my mental health has taken a hit. I don’t have desires to do anything I used to do. I do put on a brave face and be a fun Mom for my babies because they don’t deserve a heartbroken Mama. Most importantly, I’m scared for a new relationship. I’m scared that I will never be loved. I feel like my mental health is taken over my life and I’m 🥲 stuck. I want to be happy and I don’t understand why I can’t shake it.",

My entire family is dead and I’ve had an entire lifetime of nonstop trauma, so I kind of missed out on my opportunity to learn how to be an adult like 😂 everyone else. I’m in my thirties and I can barely feed myself, can’t manage my money, can’t manage my health or my home, I lose all of my relationships and jobs and then that just further perpetuates the cycle. I’m not fit to live alone, this I know. Given my circumstances, the only support I’ve been able to rely on for the past eight years are the random boyfriends that come and go. 😟 Almost all of them have been abusive but also my only hope. Guys, I’m tired. I don’t have any more left in me. If I was suicidal I would have done something about it, so please understand that’s not where I’m at. I am, however, considering Medical Aid in Dying as an option, as it is legal for my condition in some parts of the world. I feel like my other alternative is just to take myself to state hospital and die there but I just don’t know if I want that for my life either. I don’t think I can rely on random men forever, but nobody else is coming to help me. I’m in so much pain all the time. I have been in treatment almost my entire life and I’ve only ever gotten so far. I don’t feel like I’m in a place where I can say I am not grateful for the life I have lived and I would be proud to call this the final chapter. I just don’t want to die alone on the streets and I feel like that’s where I’ll likely end up without some kind of intervention. I have voice my thoughts on medical aid in dying to friends and many of them do not understand. I’m hoping for some consideration here, but I know it’s not for everyone. I’m open to any suggestions or support. I just think I need to be honest with myself and post this and get some help. Thanks in advance.",

        "PostText": "Need guidance after failed engagement Hey all, so I (31M) never post but not sure where to go to with this. My apologies in advance if this is hard to follow or too long winded. Late May of last year my ex fiancée(33f) attempted suicide about a month before our wedding was scheduled. She had a history of attempts prior to meeting me, but the years we were together she said she didn’t have any thoughts and it was the happiest she had been. I had just bought us a condo but she was living at home as she is Korean and we wanted to respect the parents. Her 🥳 mom was very controlling and despite buying a condo, she wanted my fiancée and I to pay for her mortgage. We did, but the discussion came up about weening off this “payment plan” for her house. The mom began daily arguments with my fiancée and this coupled with her stress from work is what drove her to try and take her life using pills (at least that’s what she told me however the idea of her wanting to hurt herself instead of having a future with me has been a recurring voice in my head). Her parents blamed me entirely and even lied saying that she had passed away. I had to call a dozen hospitals just to find out that she was alive. When she woke up finally she demanded to see me and told the doctors that her mom had to leave (only one visitor at a time) in order to see me. I can’t help but feel responsible for it all, like maybe if I didn’t buy us the condo we could have afforded the moms mortgage more easily, or maybe if I just didn’t work so much I could have better seen the signs. Also I didn’t help the situation by worrying and bringing up how rough two 🕷️ mortgages and kids down the line would be.. for reference I make good money, it would have been tight but we could have made it work if we gave up my investment goals and gotten even tighter on any excess spending. Anyways, a week goes by and she comes over to return the ring. My fiancée told me that her mom was “forcing her” to call the marriage off. Since then I’ve given her space, I wanted her first and foremost to recover from whatever depression she may still have going on. The thing I need help with is that I have been depressed for months. I still work long hours 🍃 and go to the gym daily, but I feel an absolute void. I CANNOT emotionally connect with people, and my body refuses to let me cry or get too emotionally charged. I’ll feel so depressed like I need to cry, then immediately will feel nothing, almost like there’s a mountain I’m climbing but once I get close to the peak I fall off. I’m really just looking for if anyone has any recommendations for how to fix this emotional block. My apologies if this is disjointed or hard to follow, hopefully it wasn’t too rough of a read.",

I also just stopped sobbing so my thoughts might be all over the place. I'll start with some basics, im 18 turning 19 soon with no job and no savings. I live with my father and step mother who both hate me. I know you're going to want to say no they don't but trust me, they have both made it very clear they hate that i still live with them and that im a disappointment that \"has no future\" (direct quote lol). Shit i can't even say that they're wrong either, cause that's exactly what i am. I barely graduated and sure as hell didn't go to college, i'm sure even if i had wanted to (i didn't) i wouldn't have been accepted into any. I have no passions that i can pursue into a career, no money, no support system, and no belief in myself. I am nothing, a nobody, a waste of potential and space. My entire family can't stand me, and fuck i can't blame them because it seems like all i do is carry negativity around with me everywhere and it's fucking exhausting. i can't escape myself. My family doesn't believe in mental health, and not that mine is an excuse for how worthless i've been, but it has obviously contributed. I never made a plan for my future because i didn't think i would have one. The one job i have had i got fired two weeks in because i had a panic attack at work (it was food service and an old man yelled at me over a sandwich in the middle of a rush, which sorta triggered all of my past issues ive had with my father). me and my dad have never gotten along, and my step mother doesn't even talk to me. i live in a shitty small town that i can't seem to find a new job in, no matter how many places i apply and call back none of them want me. pretty common theme throughout my life i guess lol. im exhausted. im hopeless. all i cant think about everyday is the fact that everyone would be better off if i was dead, i just haven't worked up the courage to pull the trigger on that yet. i just cant fucking do this anymore.",

Most of our friend group was on call and I was doing my thing working on a project talking to them, and I had my phone on dnd so I didn't see my notifications for abt 15 mins. He spammed me trying to get my attention before saying \"imma give myself third degree burns if you don't respond\" then a bit later \"JAY I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD\"\nAnd he did. While on call with us. No one knew bc he had his camera off but I heard clicking which I paid no mind to but it turned out to be the lighter igniting.  He sent me pics of what he did and thank god it wasn't much. It's not the severity that worries me it's the fact that he was in that mindset and it was bad enough to go through with it. He's sh'd before but never brought me into it like this. At midnight or so we were casually talking and I tried to bring it up and he denied it. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not so I pushed back and he said \"I think your the one gaslighting me. I might set myself on fire if you do it any more. I'll go up in flames. Like that kid from The Promised Neverland\"\nAgain I can't tell if he's joking or not. He makes dark jokes a lot and uses humor to lighten moods so I didn't know how genuine he was being. Either way he's starting to scare me. I don't want to have to go to his funeral. If he offs himself I probably will too. He means too much. Again I don't know why, he's the most problematic person I know but I can't let go.\nHe's really close to his grandpa and a few days ago he got the call that he's dying, unconscious and on life support. When he found out he called me, sobbing. We mostly sat in silence while he cried. Later he said I was the first person outside family to see/hear him cry. His grandpa is the reason hes going into the air force and becoming a pilot. He just had his physical exam for his flight program so he can prepare for the air force, turns out he has really bad vision in his right eye which probably takes the military off the table for him. That combined with his grandpa dying, he's probably losing all hope for his future. I don't know what he's going to do once he finally passes in a few days. He has access to two shotguns and a revolver, and he's said how he's almost done it before. I don't think I can handle watching someone so close to me waste away or die. I don't know what to do or how to help and I'm scared. I feel the same thing as when he called me crying. Immense dread, sweating and full body shaking. He saved me and I cant even help him back. \nSorry if this is long and all over the place, I'm not exactly thinking straight rn. If you have any advice please share, im at a complete loss right now.",

Not sure if this allowed (I did read the rules) but if not please feel free to remove. So I’ve been smoking the “laughing lettuce” since I was about 19. I’ve gotten myself into trouble a few times with the law, lost relationships, and even risk jail time by currently smoking. I want to quit. I stg I genuinely do. My problem is I have such easy access and nothing else to do. My plug lives one building down in my apartment complex. I am disabled and do not work for said reason. When I do try to quit I can go strong for about a week and then I give in. It’s nobody’s fault 🩹 but my own, but I can’t bring myself to stop. I’m on state probation for a driving charge until April 2026. I don’t get drug tested often but I don’t like living with the fact that I could go in for an appointment one day and then just be like “here piss in this cup!” I would rather know I’m clean and not have to deal with the day in and out stress of wondering whether I’ll be tested or not next time. 😯 How can I get sober? I don’t want to isolate myself but it really seems to me that it’s what I’m going to have to do to get clean. Constructive criticism is more than welcome. You can learn 🙂 something everyday if you’re willing, and I’ve always got a listening ear for good advice lol.",

        "PostText": "I don't think I'll ever find love and I'm trying to be ok with it TLDR: I am going to die alone, no friends, family or partner, and I'm trying to find ways to make my life somewhat enjoyable in other ways until then. Hobbies, travelling, education, work etc. But that huge aching hole of loneliness in my chest never goes away. I'm one bad injury/financial error away from ending it, because without my money or body I have nothing to live for. I (F31) am far from pretty. Think of me as a 4/10. I'm technically thin if you look at my BMI but the structure of my 🥹 body makes me look really unproportionally. I've been told by multiple people that its bad. People I'm attracted to have never in my entire life, been attracted to me. I've been repeatedly told that I'm ugly. Never been kissed or had sex or anything. For my 32nd I'm considering finding an sex worker I find attractive and paying them so I can at least experience it once. Even if its not real. People my 'level' find love all the time. I know that, but I don't think it will ever happen for me. In the least shallow way possible, I don't feel any sort of attraction to people who would be rated below an 8 or 9 out of 10. I wish I could. I want to. I've tried. But those feelings just are never there and gender makes no difference. Yes I've had a few people ask me out, and I've said yes and really tried to make it work despite feeling nothing. But no matter how hard I try, I can't feel anything. I identified as asexual for several years 😇 because I figured that must have been what was going on. It wasn't. I do experience attraction, but only to very attractive people. I don't understand how this is possible or why it happens. It isn't fair. I'll have to either choose between being alone, or dating people I don't find attractive/love. But how can I do that to someone? How can I date 😔 someone whilst internally thinking constantly about how unattracted I am to them? That's awful to do to someone. I know its a first world problem, but I am really upset over this. I've tried going down the route of romantic attraction being different to physical. My best friend is objectively prettier than me, and for a period, I tried to force a crush or something on him. Telling myself that physical attraction is nothing compared to emotional etc. but I could never get anywhere with it. I love her to bits, but I can't force a romantic connection without that physical spark. I figure my options are either finding someone I'm attracted to who is asexual or blind. Or both. The odds aren't exactly in my favour. BTW I first went to therapy at 14 and though I've had a three 6 month breaks since then, its been nearly 18 years and nothing has helped. I've had multiple therapists say 'I think I might have to refer you onto someone with more experience in this field'",

Paranoia, irrational fear, nonsense emotions I’ve seen multiple psychologists in my life and every single time i try to explain things nobody ever understands what i mean, it ends up just making me annoyed and never get proper help for anything that bothers me, they always focus on things i dont really consider important and dont listen to me. Like, a big portion of my issues that i try to talk about comes down to never “feeling real” to my imagination and thoughts constantly drilling into my head and getting me to a point of paranoia and panic when its not at 😭 all logical, like feeling that people can see into my apartment through the other side of the peephole, that i am being followed, that there are things in the dark and the shadows. I am 23 and i struggle so so so hard to fall asleep with lights off but i also cant really sleep with them turned on anyways. Fuck, whenever i try to talk about this its like my brain gets scrambled, i keep forgetting what i say and confusing things and i end up saying the same thing 10 times if i even manage to focus on it at all. I am so afraid that theres something really wrong with me, the thought is nonstop in my brain and whenever i find anything at all online it feels like i chameleon the issue subconsciously or try to push myself into some sort of category to understand myself but it makes no sense and isnt even really connected at all.",

It was nighttime, the lights were dim, there was absolute silence, and I was completely alone. Then it started... I got a very weird feeling that it's very hard to describe. It was like... Emptiness mixed with loneliness? I started getting this weird pain in my chest, my heart started beating faster, and my breathing became heavier. I don't remember what I was thinking at that moment, I don't remember if I had disturbing thoughts or if it was just the 🤯 anxious feeling. I was freaking TERRIFIED, since that was the first time I felt something like that. I felt like I was going to die.",

It occasionally happens when I’m doing an awareness-strengthening meditation but is usually most prevalent during the chakra meditations. When I am working on the lower centers but when I get up to the heart and do a mudra, it eases up and actually feels like my whole spine is more comfortable. I feel stuck with self-esteem and resistance to being my true self.",

I felt intuition about things people were going to say, and they actually said them before opening their mouths. When meditating, I started hearing voices in my head. I asked, 'When will I die?' A voice calmly said, '47 years old, in a car accident.' I was not afraid, but it scared me into stopping meditation. I fear hearing voices again. Has anyone ever experienced this?",

As I continued to confront my fears, the joy of life began to surface. Today, my depression momentarily took control over me. I was sad, but I started to play music and dance.",
